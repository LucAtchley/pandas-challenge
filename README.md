# pandas-challenge

In this project, I analyzed two datasets from a school district. These datasets contained information such as school type, school size, student grades, and many other important information for the school district. For this project, I used pandas in jupyter notebook to create dataframes that portray important analysis for the school board. 

Some of these DataFrames inculded the highest and lowest performing schools, math and reading scores based on schools, student scores based on school size, and school scores based on school type.

This analysis is important because it shows how the district schools struggle for more than the charter schools. This analysis can help the school board look into why charter schools are so much more successful than district schools.

Some of my code came from a sample of the data.
My tutor, Ikaneng Malapile, helped me with some of my code.
